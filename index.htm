            <h1>Anvil and Loom</h1>
            <h2>Life is Stories</h2>
            <p>Human beings create stories with our works and with our minds. We consume stories in order to share stories. We share stories with our friends, family, and just about anyone else who will listen. We pass them down to our children for them to consume and to share. Our own personal story is our true legacy.</p>
            <h2>The Plough, the Loom, and the Anvil</h2>
            <p>Anvil and Loom started as a project to delve into the imagination; as a muse to prompt and inspire creativity. The concept was that stories were forged and weaved. Sometimes it takes brute force: iron sharpens iron. Sometimes it takes a delicate and intricate touch: a single thread navigating a canvas. As a gaming concept, the anvil represents the mechanics and rules while the loom represents the history and narrative.</p>
            <p>One day, while investigating the concept further, I did a google search on "Anvil and Loom," and it uncovered a mid-19th century almanac titled "The Plough, the Loom, and the Anvil. Coincidentally, I was also exploring the concept of frontier America as a world setting; not specifically America, but the idea of a new land ripe for exploration and raw for adventure. All of these little signs were naturally intriguing.</p>
            <p>Another interesting thing was revealed to me. This almanac was a peek into the culture of the time. Every section, no matter how brief it may have been, was a story. Even the style of writing provided insight.</p>
            <h2>The Plough, aka People</h2>
            <p>What good is a story if there is no one to read it? What good is a game if there is no one to play it?</p>
            <p>People are the key. To me, the plough represents people taking everything they have learned and putting it to use. They work the land, till the soil, plant the seeds, nurture the crops, and reap the harvest. They take stories and breathe life into them. Life begets life. Life is stories.</p>
            <h2>1850 in 2023</h2>
            <p>In the introduction, there is an interesting entry about independence that is worthy of highlighting, as it is most assuredly something that we prominently struggle with in America today.</p>
            <p><i>This, we repeat it, is true independence, and the highest kind possible in any community. Wealth cannot secure such independence. Rich men are most emphatically dependent. Literary distinctions cannot make a people independent, nor even science, though the latter is essential in making efficient systems, and in adapting them to the various exigencies of the times. High cultivation is scarcely an element of independence, and sometimes presents obstacles to it. <strong>It rather consists in a general diffusion of practical wisdom, than in any high individual attainments.</strong> This is the distinctive feature of our times, compared with antiquity.</i></p>
            <p>People, more precisely, <strong>community</strong>, are/is the key.</p>
            <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Enough about my indulgences. I will pontificate on Anvil and Loom from time to time over here, as well as provide a link to the almanac. But that is not why you are here. Although all of this insight into my mind will certainly provide you with a glimpse into certain commonalities you may find in my portfolio.</p>

                    <h3>Project Muse</h3>
                    <p>Need a prompt? Struggling with writer's block? Want to give your imagination a workout? Project Muse is the humble beginnings of Anvil and Loom. Take any topic or question, generate two words (Action and Theme), and apply them to your inquiry. Project Muse is most definitively NOT an oracle, but you will be surprised at how frequently relevent the prompts are.</p>
